## The Project
This is a skeleton project with basic assets as a gift to [PinkAxolotl85](https://github.com/PinkAxolotl85)

It contains the bare basics of a website that allows the user to turn on various genes and create a horse based on the settings.

## Future implementations
- Validate gene combos so gene combos that would result in a stillbirth or otherwise unviable horse cannot be set
- add images coinciding with the various gene phenotypes
- add descriptions per gene
- add leg patterns
- allow the hoof, mane and eye colour sliders to affect the actual horse design
- allow for different colour body bases
